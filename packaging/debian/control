Description: Bare metal disaster recovery and system migration framework
 Relax-and-Recover is the leading Open Source bare metal disaster recovery and
 system migration solution. It is a modular framework with many ready-to-go
 workflows for common situations.
 .
 Relax-and-Recover produces a bootable image. This image can repartition the
 system. Once that is done it initiates a restore from backup. Restores to
 different hardware are possible. Relax-and-Recover can therefore be used
 as a migration tool as well.
 .
 Currently Relax-and-Recover supports various boot media (incl. ISO, PXE,
 OBDR tape, USB or eSATA storage), a variety of network protocols (incl. sftp,
 ftp, http, nfs, cifs) as well as a multitude of backup strategies (incl. IBM
 TSM, HP DataProtector, Symantec NetBackup, Bacula, rsync, Borg).
